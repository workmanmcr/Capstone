Name of Student: Mike Workman

Name of Project: Squad Up

Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)
This application will allow users to create a profile that showcases what games they play, what skill level they are at, what their play style is, what their available play time is, and allow them to search of similar users to play with. The user will be able to add and removes games from their profile as well as fully edit any of their information. 

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
- full CRUD for user profile.
- Select games from Api to add to profile.
- matching with similar profile. 
- User authentication

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
- Front-End = C# (I may switch to React depending on my research)
- Back-End = C#  MVC
- Frameworks = Asp.Net
- Database = MySql 
- Api = RAWG VGD 



If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

I would like to add Tournament features and gaming news such as game releases and up coming events. 
I would also like to be able to allow the user to post what they need help with if they are stuck on a certain game, area, Level, or Rank. 

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
- React js for front end maybe 
- I will research for game news and event apis 
- I will add resources as I find them.
